```diff

Code in Place is an act of community service over 900 teachers from around the world came together to 
offer a first-of-its-kind volunteer-led course called Code in Place, hosted by Stanford University. 
Code in Place was a great, uplifting, learning experience and over 10,000 students learned how to code 
in Python.

### Readme

```diff
This is one of several final project ideas. You can implement any of the final project ideas, or you can come up with your own.

In this project, the user interacts with a Thought-to-Story Generator, a creative Python application that transforms a user's
thoughts into a short, personalized story using AI.

```
### Final Project

---

## Thought Craft – your thoughts, told as stories

When the program runs, the user is first prompted to enter their thoughts. They can add multiple thoughts until they are satisfied. The program then asks the user to choose a genre for the story (Adventure, Horror, Comedy, or Fantasy), the number of lines the story should have, and additional preferences like the story’s mood, the name of the main character, the type of ending (happy, sad, cliffhanger, or open), whether the story should include dialogue, and the desired language style (formal, casual, poetic, or simple).

After collecting all these inputs, the program sends the information to an AI model (via call_gpt) to generate a unique, customized story. The final story is printed on the screen for the user to read and enjoy.
A sample interaction is shown below :
